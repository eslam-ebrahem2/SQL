# Transact-SQL (T-SQL) Guide

## 📌 Introduction
**Transact-SQL (T-SQL)** is Microsoft’s extension of SQL (Structured Query Language).  
It is mainly used in **Microsoft SQL Server** to define, manipulate, query, and control data in relational databases.  

SQL commands are divided into the following categories:

1. **DDL (Data Definition Language)** – Defines and manages database structure.  
2. **DML (Data Manipulation Language)** – Manages and manipulates data inside tables.  
3. **DQL (Data Query Language)** – Queries and retrieves data.  
4. **TCL (Transaction Control Language)** – Manages transactions and ensures data consistency.
